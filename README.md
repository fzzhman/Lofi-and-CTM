# Lofi-and-CTM

Lofi hip-hop has become increasingly popular as “productivity” music. Listeners believe that it helps them stay focused on tasks (especially those that do not involve active learning and recall, but during more passive instances of learning or focused tasks, such as researching an essay topic). 

I chose lofi hip-hop as a primary focus in this paper (compared to other popular genres for productivity such as classical music) because its specific ability to enhance mood (through invoking comforting familiarity through its nostalgic outlook), and its ability to suppress mind-wandering will contribute to my claim in this paper: the quirks associated with mind wandering present serious philosophical problems for the computational theory of mind, and instead offers further support for the embodied embedded cognition theory. 

I aim to use datasets on Lofi Music to visualize what sets the genre apart from other "focus increasing" genres (like Western classical).
